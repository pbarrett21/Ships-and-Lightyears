# Ships and Lightyears

Xelkalai has successfully implemented his travel agency
thanks to your help. He is now faced with the problem
most business people face: competition (and pirates....).


Your job is to write a Javscript program to simulate his
issues. This will involve Xelkalai's ships and a competitor,
Nonkio. Each company has two ships, a scout ship and a
passenger ship. Each must get from the start to the end
of the journey as quickly and safely as possible.
